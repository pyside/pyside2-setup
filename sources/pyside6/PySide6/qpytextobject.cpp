    \class QPyTextObject
    \brief Workaround to make possible use QTextObjectInterface on PySide.
    \ingroup richtext-processing
    Due to the technical details of how to bind C++ classes to Python, you need to use this class when you need to implement
    your own QTextObjectInterface rather than create a class inheriting from QObject and QTextObjectInterface.
